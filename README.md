Algorithm (Newton Backward Interpolation):



Algorithm (Newton Forward Interpolation):

            Step 1: Start
            Step 2: Input number of data points n
            Step 3: Input arrays x[0...n-1] and corresponding y[0...n-1][0] (i.e., f(x) values)
            Step 4: Input the value of x (say, value) to be interpolated
            Step 5: Construct the forward difference table
            
                        For i = 1 to n-1
            
                        For j = 0 to n-i-1
            
                        y[j][i] = y[j+1][i-1] - y[j][i-1]
            Step 6: Calculate h = x[1] - x[0]
            Step 7: Compute u = (value - x[0]) / h
            Step 8: Initialize sum = y[0][0] and term = 1
            Step 9: For i = 1 to n-1
            
                        term = term * (u - (i - 1))
            
            sum = sum + (term * y[0][i]) / fact(i)
            Step 10: Output interpolated value sum
            Step 11: Stop





Algorithm (Bisection Method):




Algorithm (Lagrange Interpolation):

            Step 1: Start
            Step 2: Input number of points n, arrays x[n] and y[n], and value of x to be interpolated
            Step 3: Initialize result = 0
            Step 4: For i = 0 to n-1
                - Set term = y[i]
                - For j = 0 to n-1, j â‰  i:
                    term = term * (x - x[j]) / (x[i] - x[j])
                - result = result + term
            Step 5: Output result
            Step 6: Stop
